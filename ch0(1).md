## 在Terminal中运行ex5。

  输入：python3 ex5.py
  返回： File "ex5.py", line 9
    print "Let's talk about %s." % my_name
    ^
    SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'

- 第一个问题依然是print()和print的切换问题。

## 加上圆括号后

      输入：python3 ex5.py
      返回：Let's talk about %s.
           Traceback (most recent call last):
           File "ex5.py", line 9, in <module>
           print("Let's talk about %s.") % my_name
           TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for %: 'NoneType' and 'str'

* 提示：
 In python3, print is a function that returns None. So, the line:

 print ("number of donuts: " ) +str(count)
 you have None + str(count).

 What you probably want is to use string formatting:

 print ("Number of donuts: {}".format(count))


* print ("number of donuts: " ) +str(count)
                            ^
  Move it here:

  print ("number of donuts: " + str(count))
                                        ^
  Or just use a comma:

  print("number of donuts:", count)

## 更改括号位置后，运行成功
